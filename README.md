# *Holiday Sales*



## BACKGROUND

Holiday sales numbers have long been regarded as a strong GDP growth indicator. If sales numbers are high there's a strong correlation to growth in GDP. When there is a downturn in GDP, gold prices tend to rise. Gold has long been used as a safety net during times of economic downturn by investors.
Using this information, we will test out 28 years worth of data to build various machine learning (supervised and unsupervised) to attempt to predict holiday sales numbers. In turn it can be infer from this information whether there will be GDP growth and whether gold prices will rise or fall.

## QUESTIONS TO BE ANSWERED:

1. Is there a correlation between high holiday sales number and GDP growth?

2. Is there a negative correlation between GDP and gold prices and the retail index and gold prices?

3. Can we predict gold prices by predicting holiday sales?

## PROCEDURE

Using 28 years of past holiday sales data, NYT news sentiment(NLP), GDP raw data, unemployment numbers, gas prices, consumer sentiments,inflation, retail index, and gold returns we use this data to predict 2020 holiday sales. If the holiday sales are high, we can assume there will be growth in GDP, therefore gold prices will drop and vice versa.
